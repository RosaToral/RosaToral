- 👋 Hi, I’m @RosaToral
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end development, videogames development, servers administration, software engineering and the improvement of programs with faster algorithms, AI and concurrent programing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pygame, Kivy, React and React Native Expo, but I'm also looking for linux command line and shell, ethical hacking, networking and Data Science.
- 💞️ I’m collaboring right now with the proyecto MosyNetI (Modular System Network Iztapalapa) wich already won a prize thanks to Lacnic FRIDA where I'm learning a lot about networking and practicing my skills with python.
